# ucors?

Tool that finds CORS misconfigurations.

```sh
go install github.com/wfinn/ucors@latest

echo https://target.tld/endpoint | ucors
cat urls.txt | ucors -c session=xyz123
```

Many bypasses only work in Safari.

## Payloads
- http(s)://evil.com
- https://target.tld.evil.com
- https://target.tldevil.com
- null (sandboxed iframes can have origin null)
- https://wwwxtarget.tld (unescaped dots in regexes)
- https://target.wtf (different TLDs)
- https://target.tld&.evil.com (unexpected chars in subdomains)
- Bonus check: xss on subdomains https://any.target.tld

## Flags
- -p to only print the generated bypasses and not make any requests
- -d evil.com to set the attacker domain
- -s to skip the url after finding a bypass
- -c abc=XYZ to set cookies
- -a abcXYZ to set the Authorization header
